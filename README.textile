h1. WWW::UserVoice::API

This is a (for now) rather crude and simple implementation of the uservoice-api.
It only supports getting suggestions for a forum, and returns those as a array 
of hash.


h2. TODO

* Implement more of the API
* Better remote testing (For now depends on my employers account)
* The API might need to return something better than hash'es
